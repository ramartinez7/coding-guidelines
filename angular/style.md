- Follow the official [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)
- Use TypeScript strict mode (`"strict": true` in tsconfig.json)
- Enable Angular strict template checking
- Prefer `readonly` for properties that don't change after initialization
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed
- Avoid `var` entirely
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for components, services, and variables
- Component selectors should use kebab-case with a project-specific prefix (e.g., `app-user-list`)
- Use `OnPush` change detection strategy by default
- Prefer reactive patterns with the `async` pipe over manual subscriptions
- Use standalone components (Angular 14+) for new components when possible
- Place one component per file
- Keep templates small; extract complex templates to separate components
- Use TypeScript path aliases for cleaner imports (e.g., `@app/shared` instead of `../../../shared`)
- Implement `OnDestroy` and unsubscribe from observables when using manual subscriptions
- Use `trackBy` functions with `*ngFor` directives
- Avoid logic in templates; move complex expressions to component methods or computed properties
- Use Angular's built-in validators; create custom validators for reusable validation logic
- Prefer immutable data operations (spread operator, array methods that return new arrays)
- Use proper TypeScript access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)
- Avoid `any` type; use `unknown` if the type is truly unknown and narrow it with type guards
