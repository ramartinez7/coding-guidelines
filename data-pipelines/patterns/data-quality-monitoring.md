# Data Quality Monitoring

> Continuously monitor data quality metrics—completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness—and alert on anomalies.

## Problem

Data quality degrades silently. Without monitoring, bad data flows through pipelines undetected, corrupting downstream systems and analytics. By the time issues are discovered, the impact is widespread.

## Coming Soon

This pattern will cover:
- Quality dimensions (completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, validity)
- Automated quality checks at each pipeline stage
- Statistical anomaly detection
- Quality metrics and dashboards
- Alerting on quality degradation
- Data profiling and expectations
