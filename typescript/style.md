- Use `readonly` modifiers for properties that shouldn't change after initialization.
- Prefer `const` over `let`; avoid `var` entirely.
- Use interfaces for object shapes, type aliases for unions and complex types.
- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` (`"strict": true`).
- Use explicit return types on public functions.
- Prefer named exports over default exports for better refactoring support.
- Use template literals for string interpolation instead of concatenation.
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) where appropriate.
- Organize imports: third-party packages, then local modules, separated by empty lines.
- Use trailing commas in multi-line arrays and objects for cleaner diffs.
